### Personal Satement
> Candidate should describe succinctly your reasons for applying to the programme, your preparation for the field of study, future career plans, and other aspects of your background and interests that may help in the evaluation of your aptitude and motivation for graduate studies.

### Academic Statement of Purpose (SOP)
> This statement should include your goals and background as it relates to the field of computer science. It is good to include any past work history, your interests, and reasons for pursuing a graduate degree. Your statement will be evaluated for your conciseness, reasons for pursuing a graduate degree, leadership skills, and eloquence.

### Research Satement and Research Proposal
> Research Statements from professors/research scientists/Ph.D. Students often yield insight into not only their goals, but also areas of active research in general which is why I’m including some samples for candidates to read in order to ‘get a better idea of their field’ before writing their Statement of Purpose.

### Miscellaneous between SOP and PS
To me, the major difference between PS and SOP is that Personal Statement (PS) requires a frameworked story about your life which illustrates your future career goal and interest. A Statement of Purpose (SOP), on the other hand
